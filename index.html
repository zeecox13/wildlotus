            <h4>Case Study: Maya R.</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Maya was overwhelmed with DMs and inconsistent payouts across multiple platforms. She was burning out and considering quitting.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We took over account management and chatting, set up clear boundaries and response templates, and negotiated a payment schedule that worked with her cash flow.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Within 6 months, her revenue stabilized and she was able to cut her screen time in half while growing her subscriber base. She now focuses on content and wellness while we handle the rest.</p>

            <h4>Case Study: James T.</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> James had steady traffic but no clear brand or long-term strategy. He felt stuck between “just a creator” and something more professional.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We ran a brand development sprint: visual identity, content pillars, and a rollout plan across OnlyFans, Fansly, and socials. We also set up account management so he could maintain consistency.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> His following grew 40% in the first year, and he landed two paid brand collaborations. He now has a recognizable brand and a sustainable schedule.</p>

            <h4>Case Study: Sofia L.</h4>
            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Sofia faced platform policy issues and anxiety around payouts and chargebacks. She was hesitant to speak up for herself with support teams.</p>
            <p><strong>Approach:</strong> We handled all platform communications, documented her accounts, and built a clear process for disputes. We also set weekly check-ins to align on workload and boundaries.</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> Chargebacks were reduced and resolved faster. Sofia’s stress dropped significantly, and she’s since expanded to two new platforms with our support.</p>
