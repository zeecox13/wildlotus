        <h1>About Wild Lotus Management</h1>
        <p>We’re a team of women who’ve been in the industry for years. Our mission is simple: create a safe space for creators and advocate fiercely for their money, their boundaries, and their mental health.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Wild Lotus Management was built from a simple truth: adult content creators deserve the same level of professional support, protection, and advocacy as any other professional. We saw too many talented people burn out, get taken advantage of, or struggle alone with platforms and boundaries.</p>
        <p>We’re run by women, but we’re open to male and female clients from all walks of life. Whether you’re just starting out or you’ve been in the industry for years, we believe everyone deserves a team that has their back.</p>

        <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
        <p><strong>Safe space.</strong> We provide an environment where you can be honest about your goals, your limits, and your mental health. No judgment—just support.</p>
        <p><strong>Expert advocacy.</strong> We’ve spent years navigating platforms, policies, and payouts. We know how to protect your accounts, your revenue, and your reputation.</p>
        <p><strong>Hands-on experience.</strong> We don’t just give advice—we’ve managed accounts, handled DMs, and built brands from the ground up. We know what it takes to succeed.</p>
        <p><strong>Your money and your mind.</strong> We care about both. We help you grow revenue while also protecting your time, boundaries, and wellbeing.</p>

        <h2>Who We Work With</h2>
        <p>We work with creators on OnlyFans, SextPanther, Playboy, Fansly, Fanfix, and major social media platforms. We offer full-scale management, account management and chatting, brand development, and consultations for those who don’t need full management but want expert guidance.</p>
        <p>If you’re ready for a team that treats your career and your wellbeing with the respect they deserve, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
